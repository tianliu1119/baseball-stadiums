Feature: View the map of all the stadiums in the country

As a user, I will be able to see the map of all of the stadiums in the country and the path traveled between any number of stadiums if necessary.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The user will be able to see the map displayed in the middle of the window at all times.
- The user will be shown the path traveled if they are planning a trip or calculating the distance between two stadiums. The path will be highlighted as well as the stadiums visited.
- The user will be able to click on any stadium displayed on the map.

Definition of Done:

- The map reacts to whatever actions the user performs such as planning a trip or calculating the shortest distance between two stadiums.
- If the user clicks on a stadium on the map, a list of possible actions will be displayed that will allow the administrator to modify the stadiumâ€™s information.

Tasks:

- Implement the GUI for this functionality.
- Implement the GUI function(s) (MainWindow function) to display/highlight the shortest path from the origin to the destination on the map.
- Implement the GUI function(s) to allow the user to click on any random baseball stadium and make the GUI display a list of possible actions in the form of push buttons to allow the user to make changes to the stadium.

Tests:

- The distances and paths calculated should be the shortest possible.
